Write a Fortran subroutine in a module that fits a finite mixture of
normals with a specified # of components to univariate data, using the
EM algorithm, and write a main program that tests it for data
simulated from a known mixture distribution. Declare real variables as
real(kind=dp) with

integer, parameter :: dp = kind(1.0d0)

Define a derived type to store the parameters of a finite mixture, and
write a subroutine to display the parameters in a formatted table. Use
the subroutine to display the true and estimated parameters. Declare
procedures as pure or elemental when feasible.
